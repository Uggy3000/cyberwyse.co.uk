Detailed Penetration Testing Service Overviews


Web Application Penetration Testing

Think of your web application as the digital storefront of your business. It's often the first point of contact for your customers, and unfortunately, a primary target for attackers. Our web application penetration testing goes beyond simple scans; we provide a human-led, comprehensive assault on your application's defenses. We don't just check for common vulnerabilities; we simulate a determined attacker to uncover hidden flaws in your logic, authentication, and session management. By identifying and fixing these issues before they can be exploited, we protect your brand reputation, customer data, and bottom line.

How We Do It:

Our methodology is thorough and follows a proven framework. We begin with reconnaissance to map your application's attack surface. Then, our experts perform both authenticated and unauthenticated testing, looking for weaknesses from both a user's and an outsider's perspective. We meticulously examine every API endpoint to ensure secure data exchange. Crucially, we integrate DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) into your development lifecycle, ensuring that security is a continuous process, not just a one-time check.

Tools We Use:


Burp Suite Pro: An industry-standard, all-in-one platform for web penetration testing. It allows us to intercept, analyze, and manipulate traffic, identify vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), and automate repetitive tasks.

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): A powerful open-source tool that helps us find a wide range of security vulnerabilities in web applications during the development and testing phases.

Custom Scripts and Frameworks: For a truly unique and effective attack simulation, our team develops custom scripts in languages like Python to test specific, unique business logic and evade standard defenses.

Network & Infrastructure Penetration Testing

Your network is the nervous system of your organization, and a single weak point can compromise the entire body. Our network and infrastructure penetration testing is a proactive check-up to ensure that every part of your digital infrastructure is robust. We hunt for misconfigurations, unpatched systems, and insecure services that could give a malicious actor a foothold. By finding these flaws, we empower you to fortify your defenses and prevent a catastrophic breach.

How We Do It:
We follow the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES), a globally recognized methodology for ethical hacking. This involves extensive reconnaissance and threat modeling to understand your environment. Our team then performs both external and internal testing. External tests simulate an an attack from the internet, while internal tests mimic an insider threat or a compromised device. We check for everything from outdated software to insecure network device configurations, providing a full picture of your infrastructure's health.

Tools We Use:


Nmap: The undisputed champion for network discovery and security auditing. It allows us to quickly map network topologies, identify open ports, and discover services running on your hosts.

Metasploit Framework: A powerful tool used for developing and executing exploit code against a target system. Our ethical hackers use it to test for exploitable vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

Nessus: A leading vulnerability scanner that helps us identify known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance issues across your network.

Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer that lets us capture and inspect network traffic, crucial for finding data leaks or insecure communications.

Cloud Penetration Testing
The cloud offers incredible flexibility and scale, but it also introduces unique security challenges. A single misconfiguration can expose vast amounts of sensitive data. Our cloud penetration testing services are designed to address the specific complexities of platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. We validate your configurations, test your identity and access management policies, and ensure that your cloud-native applications are as secure as possible.

How We Do It:
Our approach is tailored to the Shared Responsibility Model of cloud security. We focus on the areas that are your responsibility, including your configurations, security groups, and identity and access management (IAM) policies. We conduct thorough configuration reviews to ensure your cloud environment is hardened against common attacks. Our testing covers IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) deployments, and includes specialized assessments for platforms like Microsoft 365, which often contain critical data and present unique attack vectors.

Tools We Use:

Pacu: An open-source exploitation framework for Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows us to perform controlled attacks to identify vulnerabilities in your AWS environment.

ScoutSuite: A multi-cloud security-auditing tool that can detect security risks across your AWS, Azure, and GCP accounts.

Terraform/CloudFormation parsers: We use automated tools to analyze your Infrastructure as Code to find misconfigurations before they are even deployed.

Mobile Application Penetration Testing
In a mobile-first world, your app is a direct gateway to your users. It's also a high-value target, often containing sensitive user data and interacting with your back-end services. Our mobile application penetration tests uncover flaws in the app itself, in its communication with your servers, and in its storage of data on the device. We ensure that your app provides the seamless, secure experience your users expect.

How We Do It:
Our proven methodology combines static and dynamic analysis. We perform a SAST (Static Application Security Testing) review, which is a meticulous line-by-line inspection of your app's source code to find vulnerabilities. We then perform a dynamic analysis to test the app in a live environment, checking how it handles data, stores credentials, and communicates with APIs. This dual approach ensures we find both coding errors and runtime vulnerabilities.

Tools We Use:

Frida: A dynamic instrumentation toolkit that allows our testers to inject custom code into running processes. This is invaluable for runtime analysis and bypassing security controls.

MobSF (Mobile Security Framework): An automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing and malware analysis tool.

Reverse Engineering Tools: We use tools like JADX and Ghidra to decompile and analyze the app's code, ensuring there are no hidden backdoors or insecure functionalities.

Social Engineering Penetration Testing
Technology is only one layer of defense; the human element is often the weakest link. Our social engineering assessments are designed to test your employees' security vigilance and your organization's resilience against manipulation. We don't aim to embarrass anyone; our goal is to educate your team and build a culture of security awareness that can withstand a sophisticated phishing or vishing attack.

How We Do It:
We tailor each social engineering campaign to your unique security objectives. This can include targeted phishing campaigns via email to test employees' ability to spot malicious links, vishing (voice phishing) attacks to test their response to a fraudulent phone call, or even smishing (SMS phishing) attacks. Our tests are conducted in a controlled, safe manner, followed by detailed reporting and security awareness training to turn your human vulnerability into your strongest defense.

Custom Communication Platforms: We use encrypted and secure communication channels to ensure all our testing remains within the scope of the engagement.

Red Team Security Testing
When a standard penetration test isn't enough, you need to bring in the Red Team. This is a full-scope, no-holds-barred security exercise that simulates a highly motivated and skilled cyber criminal. Our Red Team engagements test your entire organization—people, processes, and technology—against a multi-pronged, stealthy attack. This is the ultimate test of your security maturity and your incident response capabilities.

How We Do It:
Our Red Team engagements are long-term, objective-based missions. We begin with a defined objective, such as compromising a critical server or exfiltrating sensitive data. Our team then works to achieve this goal by combining digital attacks with physical penetration testing to test all layers of your organization’s security. We model real-world attack chains, using a variety of techniques to remain undetected for as long as possible. The engagement culminates in a comprehensive report detailing not only the vulnerabilities we exploited but also how your Blue Team responded (or didn't).

Tools We Use:

Custom C2 (Command and Control) Frameworks: Our Red Team utilizes bespoke C2 frameworks to maintain stealth and persistence within a network.

Physical Security Bypass Tools: A variety of tools for physical intrusion, including lock-picking sets, RFID cloners, and covert cameras, are used in a legal and ethical manner with client consent.
